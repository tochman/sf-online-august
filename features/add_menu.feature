Feature: As a restaurant Owner
  in order to sell food
  I need to be able to add one or more menus.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a restaurant owner

  Scenario: Viewing the Add Menu page
    Given I am on the "add menu" page
    Then I should see:
      | content  |
      | Add menu |
    And I should see "create" button

  Scenario: Adding a menu
    Given I am on the "add menu" page
    When I fill in "title" with "Awesome Menu"
    And I click the "create" button
    Then I should see "Successfully added menu"

  Scenario: Viewing my menu
    Given I create a menu "Lunch"
    Then I should see "Successfully added menu"
    Then I should see "Lunch"

  Scenario: Not adding a menu
    Given I am on the "add menu" page
    When I fill in:
      | element | content |
      | title   |         |
    And I click the "create" button
    Then I should see "Title can't be blank"
